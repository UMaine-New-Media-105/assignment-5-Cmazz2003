Question 1: We were instructed to create 5 bubbles on canvas. I didn't change mine at all, I did it exactly how the guy did it in the video. They are made using a class and an array

Question 2: We were instructed to create 50 bubbles on the canvas this time. Again, I used an array and a class to make them.

Question 3: I added my breeders and my catchers. The particles are bubble because it's supposed to have an underwater theme to it. That being said my breeders were fish and my catchers were sharks

Question 4: I made the breeders and catchers move about and what not using classes and arrays once more.

Question 5: I honestly have no idea why my sketch isn't working I have tried everything to make them interact, but I just can't get it to work properly.
